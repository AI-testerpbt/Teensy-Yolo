This file explains how the full system works. No cheat code is included or provided.

The cheat system operates using three devices or layers:

1. Main Gaming PC:
- The game is running here.
- OBS is used in fullscreen to mirror the game to the external AI device.

2. External AI Laptop:
- A trained YOLO model or object detection system processes the screen feed (from OBS or HDMI capture).
- When a target is detected in a defined region (e.g., crosshair zone), a signal is sent to the receiver.

3. Receiver + Teensy Device:
- The receiver (Python script) listens for AI commands.
- It passes the command to a Teensy microcontroller (via USB serial).
- Teensy translates the command into raw mouse input using the Mouse.h library.
- The input reaches the main PC as if a human moved and clicked.
